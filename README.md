## Simple MERN CRUD App with Vite

This is a modern MERN stack application built for a fast and efficient development experience, leveraging the power of Vite:

* **M**ongoDB - NoSQL database for data storage
* **E**xpress.js - Web framework for the backend API
* **R**eact.js - JavaScript library for building the frontend UI
* **N**ode.js - JavaScript runtime environment for running the backend server
* **V**ite - Ultra-fast build tool for a smooth development workflow

This app allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of data.

### Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can check by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.
    * A basic understanding of MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and Vite is helpful.

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rexleonem/mern-crud.git
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd mern-crud
    npm install (or yarn install)
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev (or yarn dev)
    ```

This will start both the backend server and the frontend development server using Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) for lightning-fast updates in the browser as you code. The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (port may vary).

### Features

* Create new data entries
* View a list of all data entries
* Edit existing data entries
* Delete data entries
* Fast and seamless development experience with Vite's HMR

### Usage

The application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the data. You can add new entries, view existing entries, edit their details, and delete them. Changes made in the React components should reflect instantly in the browser without full page reloads, thanks to Vite's HMR.

### Technologies Used

* MongoDB
* Express.js
* React.js
* Node.js
* Mongoose
* React Router
* Vite 

**Note:** This is a basic CRUD application and can be extended to include additional features and functionalities.
